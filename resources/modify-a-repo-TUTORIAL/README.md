## Overview
How to submit your engineering empathy reflections

## Topics Covered / Key words:
- git cloning
- git pushing
- terminal commands

## What you need to create
  Reflection files pushed to Github, stored in the correct place in your cohort's private repo.
  Within your cohorts repo:
  `EE/`YOURFIRSTNAME-YOURLASTNAME`/sprint-`SPRINT_NUMBER`/`REFLECTION_NAME_1.md  
  e.g.  
  `EE/anahi-jacobson/sprint-1/habits.md`  
  `EE/anahi-jacobson/sprint-1/time-management.md`  

## How to add your reflections

1. Clone your cohort's repo from the github dev-academy-phase0 org
  1. Find the repo on github
  2. Copy the 'clone' url up the top of the page
  3. In your terminal, navigate into your EDAworkspace directory using 
    - `cd` to move, 
    - `ls` to look around the current directory and 
    - `pwd` to check your current location.
  4. Clone the repo to your EDAworkspace, using `git clone PASTE_CLONE_URL_HERE`
2. Navigate into your cohort's repo (that you just cloned down)
3. Navigate to the EE directory
4. Create (`mkdir`)/navigate to a directory named YOURFIRSTNAME-YOURLASTNAME
4. Navigate into that directory
4. Create (`mkdir`)/navigate to a directory named `sprint-`SPRINTNUMBER
4. Navigate into that directory
5. Create (`touch`) new reflection files
5. Commit changes as you make them
  1. `git status`
  2. `git add FILENAME`
  3. `git status`
  4. `git commit -m `add SHORT_DESCRIPTION_OF_REFLECTION`
  5. `git status`
6. Push your local changes to the Github remote `git push origin master`
7. Visit the repo on https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0 and check that your reflections are in the repo in the `EE/`YOURNAME`/spint-`SPRINT_NUM`/` directory

Done!
