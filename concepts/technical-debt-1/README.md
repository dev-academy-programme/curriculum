# Technical Debt Part 1

## Overview
Writing tidy code is like doing your dishes after you cook. If you don't do the dishes, they'll stack up, get mouldy, start smelling. When you or someone else needs to cook again, it'll be a painful - and necessary - process to do all the old dishes before you cook something new.  

> Technical Debt is a wonderful metaphor developed by Ward Cunningham to help us think about this problem. In this metaphor, doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar to a financial debt. Like a financial debt, the technical 
> debt incurs interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development because of the quick > and dirty design choice.

Some styleguides will differ in opinion on topics. The one thing they all agree on is the importance of consistency.  
Google styleguide's parting words:
>Be consistent.

>If you’re editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators, you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.

>The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you’re saying rather than on how you’re saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Avoid this.
