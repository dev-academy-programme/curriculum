# Pseudocode

## Overview
Pseudocode is an informal tool that you can use to plan out your algorithms. As you begin to write more complex code, it can be hard to keep an entire program in your head before coding it. 

Think of pseudocode as a step-by-step verbal outline of your code that you can later transcribe into a programming language. 

It is a combination of human language and programming language: it mimics the syntax of actual computer code, but it is more concerned with readability than with technical specificity." - [wikiHow to write pseudocode](http://www.wikihow.com/Write-Pseudocode)

It is important to pseudocode so that you solve the logic before getting lost in the intricacies of javascript syntax!

We expect to see something like:
```javascript
// open the file
  // for each line in the file:
    // look for the word by doing this:
      // read the character in the line
      // if the character matches, then:
        // if all of the following characters match,
        // then there is a true match.
        // remove the characters of that word
        // insert the characters of the new word
// then close the file.
```
