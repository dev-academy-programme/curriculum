# Welcome to Git and Github
The web developers' best friends
## Overview
### Git
Git is beautiful version control software - it manages and records changes to files and documents in a project. 
This means that it is possible to:
  1. Have one master copy of the project
  2. Give everyone access to a copy of the project that they can work on
  3. Have many people working on the same project without messing up each others work
  4. Roll back to previous versions of the project

### GitHub
GitHub is an online interface to easily use Git to collaborate with many people. GitHub hosts your projects online and adds some extra functionality to git such as 'issues' and 'pull requests'.

### Git vs GitHub
Git is the tool
GitHub is the service for projects that use git
